This summer I had the opportunity to travel abroad to Rwanda to build a water distribution system in a small village called Rubona. In Rwanda, I drafted design solutions on-the-fly and communicated desipte language barriers, not to mention the personal impacts of the local culture and landscape. My particular role focuses on the structure we are building -- a pipeline and tank to serve the community. Through this role I learned how to add value to pre-existing projects by understanding the existing project base and learning the skills to move the project forward. For example, I developed AutoCAD proficiency to work with the drawings efficiently and clearly. Below are some pictures from the trip:

Thank you to EPICS at Purdue for this amazing experience and to all the team members who made this project possible!
