Earlier this year I discovered that weather balloons are vital parts of exploring the upper atmosphere and beginning of space, so I set out to build my own! So, in this project I built an Arduino data recorder that recorded GPS, elevation, and temperature of the payload. I also designed and constructed the weather balloon itself. Some key challenges I faced were in creating a functional NEMA parser for my gps model and correcting the pin-outs from the sample design. Below are some pictures of the final product:\n \nThis test above is a tethered test which I performed to test my design and gather data. I chose not to release the balloon due to the difficulties of recovery, especially from my launch site on the East Coast, where the balloon is highly likely to end up in the Atlanic. With that outline finished, here are the steps I took in my project:\n\n  Learned about weather balloons and accessible student space exploration through an MIT online lecture.\n  Researched weather balloon applications, regulations, and existing content\n  Contacted and Called Expert David Paterson to learn about the realities of weather balloon launches\n  Developed a plan and Bought materials\n  Constructed Aurdino prototype basing my design on this existing schematic\n  Built the Weather Balloon on-site and Launched!\n\n\nIt was an awesome experience and I would recommend trying it yourself!\n",

In Rwanda, I drafted design solutions on-the-fly and communicated desipte language barriers, not to mention the personal impacts of the local culture and landscape. My particular role focuses on the structure we are building – a pipeline and tank to serve the community. Through this role I learned how to add value to pre-existing projects by understanding the existing project base and learning the skills to move the project forward. For example, I developed AutoCAD proficiency to work with the drawings efficiently and clearly.

Click here or on the Projects tab to see some of the projects I have done.\n\nA Little About Me\n\nI have a wide range of interests including music and theater, computing and science, and geopolitics and economics. In my free time I love to play guitar, sing, read, and learn. A few recommendations of mine are …\n\n\n  Music: Dave Matthews Band (Crash), Foo Fighters (Greatest Hits), Newsies Soundtrack\nBooks: Where’s My Flying Car, The Changing World Order, Isaac Asimov (Foundation)\nVideo: The Great War, CGP Grey, Crash Course\n\n\nI love to travel, and after working and saving I backpacked through Europe Summer 2022.\n\n \n\nThis backpacking trip was a great way to see the continent and test my independence! In the future I plan on studying abroad in Europe and perhaps even move to the UK.\n",

    "content": "EWB Water Project in Rwanda\n\nIn this project I paticipated in the Engineering design process for the construction of a water distribution system in the rural community of Rubona Rwanda, right outside of the capital of the country, Kigali. I had the opportunity to travel to Rwanda Summer 2023 for two weeks to implement Phase 1 of our system.During this project, I designed and modeled the water system, surveyed and assessed future feasibility, and explained our project to community members. The cultural immersion and professional work was incredibly impactful.

I created this site using GitHub Pages hosting and the Jekyll static site generator. I learned how to use DNS hosting, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and the Jekyll interface, while also developing confidence in learning new languages and interfaces. To read on how I specifically built this site, click here\n\nWeather Balloon\n\nI designed, built, and launched a weather balloon to measure atmospheric data. In this project, I built my own data recorder using an Arduino and several sensors. I built off of an existing code base, rewriting the NEMA parser to work with my GPS unit. I also designed the weather balloon, calculating weight and lift and designing for high atmospheric conditions. Through this project I developed my C coding skills and engineering ability.
