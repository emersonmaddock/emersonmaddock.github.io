I have learned the jekyll interface from scratch and used it to generate the static pages you are viewing. Using jekyll and hosting through GitHub Pages have both been pretty intuitive, here are the steps I took if you want to do it yourself:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Downloaded Jekyll following <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home">docs</a></li>
  <li>Followed Quickstart and launched localhost starting website</li>
  <li>Examined interface to understand how to use it – Notice the intuitive use of markdown and file structure</li>
  <li>Set up Visual Studio Code and uploaded the Quickstart to Github</li>
  <li>Set up <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">GitHub Pages</a></li>
  <li>Found a theme I liked – <a href="https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/">alembic</a> – and followed their extended interface</li>
  <li>Launch and Continued Working</li>
</ol>
